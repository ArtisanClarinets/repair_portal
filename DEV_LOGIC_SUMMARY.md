# Developer Logic Summary
## Repair Portal ‚Äì Key Automation & Integration (2025-07-14)

### üü¢ **What was accomplished today?**

#### 1. **Merged `Repair Request` ‚Üí `Repair Order` (ERPNext v15)**
- All fields, business logic, reports, and downstream automation now use `Repair Order` exclusively.
- Custom fields from `Repair Request` manually reviewed and merged into `Repair Order` (using Customize Form, *not* fixtures).
- Workflow: All states and transitions ported to `Repair Order ‚Äì Advanced` workflow.
- Data migration patch provided (see `/patches/v15_merge_repair_request_to_repair_order.py`).
- Old doctype left in place for archival, pending UAT and backup before removal.
- Reports, APIs, and portals now reference only `Repair Order`.

#### 2. **Clarinet Intake ‚Üí Repair Order Automation**
- On submit of a Clarinet Intake **(intake_type == 'Inventory')**:
  - Ensures required fields (`serial_no`, `received_date`) are present.
  - Auto-creates Instrument Profile (if not linked).
  - Auto-creates Quality Inspection (if not linked).
  - **NEW:** Checks if a `Repair Order` exists for this serial/intake; if not, creates one and links it back to Intake (field: `linked_repair_order`).
  - All exceptions are logged with `frappe.log_error()` and never block submit.
  - Field `linked_repair_order` is visible for desk and audit trace.

#### 3. **Intake-Related Automations: Thorough Search & Audit**
- All intake logic reviewed across:
  - `/intake/doctype/clarinet_intake` (controller, js, json)
  - `/inspection/doctype/initial_intake_inspection`, `/clarinet_inspection`, `/intake_inspection`
  - `/instrument_profile/doctype/intake_entry`, `/instrument_intake_batch`
  - `/intake/utils/emailer.py` (notifies customer)
  - `/intake/report`, `/intake/dashboard_chart`, and all related test suites
- Ensured **no stray intake automations** remain in other modules.

#### 4. **Documentation & Auditability**
- All controller logic is now PEP8, typed, with docstrings and inline comments.
- `CHANGELOG.md` and this file (`DEV_LOGIC_SUMMARY.md`) explain the entire migration and automation chain.
- Safe for Fortune-500, SOC-2, and ISO handoff: No hidden server scripts, no duplicate logic, all errors handled gracefully.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **What to watch for?**
- *Never remove legacy doctypes/scripts until all data is backed up and UAT is signed off!*
- If you add new intake types, update controller logic and doctype fields accordingly.
- Always check `/CHANGELOG.md` for deployment or rollback steps.
