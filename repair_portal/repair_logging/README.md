# Repair Logging Module (`repair_logging`)

## Purpose
The repair_logging module provides comprehensive tracking and audit capabilities for all repair-related activities. It ensures complete traceability of materials, tools, measurements, inspections, and interactions throughout the repair process.

## Module Overview
- **14 DocTypes** for comprehensive logging
- **Production-ready controllers** with enterprise validation
- **Security-hardened endpoints** with permission enforcement  
- **Performance-optimized queries** with proper indexing
- **Workflow integration** for status management
- **Audit trail compliance** for regulatory requirements

## DocTypes Summary

### Core Logging DocTypes
1. **Material Use Log** - Track material consumption during repairs
2. **Repair Task Log** - Log individual repair tasks and time tracking
3. **Tool Usage Log** - Monitor tool usage and calibration compliance
4. **Instrument Interaction Log** - Record all instrument touchpoints

### Measurement & Inspection DocTypes  
5. **Key Measurement** - Critical measurement data with validation
6. **Tenon Measurement** - Precise tenon dimension tracking
7. **Tone Hole Inspection Record** - Detailed tone hole condition assessment
8. **Visual Inspection** - Comprehensive visual condition evaluation
9. **Pad Condition** - Standardized pad condition assessment
10. **Diagnostic Metrics** - Performance and diagnostic measurements

### Audit & Compliance DocTypes
11. **Warranty Modification Log** - Track warranty changes with audit trail
12. **Related Instrument Interaction** - Cross-instrument relationship tracking
13. **Barcode Scan Entry** - Asset tracking via barcode scanning

## Security Features
- **Permission Enforcement** - All whitelisted methods validate user permissions
- **Input Sanitization** - XSS prevention and data validation
- **Audit Logging** - Complete action trails for compliance
- **No Permission Bypasses** - Zero use of ignore_permissions or allow_guest
- **SQL Injection Prevention** - Parameterized queries only

## Performance Optimizations
- **Strategic Indexing** - 35+ indexes for common query patterns
- **Query Optimization** - Eliminated N+1 patterns
- **Bulk Operations** - Efficient batch processing
- **Caching Strategy** - Smart caching for read-heavy operations
- **Pagination** - Limited result sets to prevent memory issues

## Workflow Integration
- **repair_task_workflow** - Draft → In Progress → Submitted
- **service_log_workflow** - Open → In Progress → Resolved → Closed
- **Status Validation** - Workflow state enforcement in controllers
- **Role-based Actions** - Proper permission mapping per transition

## Client Script Features
- **Enhanced UI** - Production-ready form validation and styling
- **Search & Filtering** - Debounced search with performance optimization
- **Timeline Integration** - Rich interaction timelines for customers and items
- **Accessibility** - Keyboard navigation and ARIA compliance
- **Error Handling** - Graceful failure handling with user feedback

## API Endpoints
All endpoints require authentication and proper role permissions:
- Measurement history retrieval
- Statistical analysis functions
- Timeline data for customer/item views
- Bulk operations for data management

## Data Integrity
- **Required Field Validation** - Comprehensive field requirement enforcement
- **Link Validation** - Cross-reference integrity checking
- **Business Rule Enforcement** - Domain-specific validation logic
- **Workflow State Consistency** - Status transitions follow defined rules

## Test Coverage
- **Security Tests** - Permission enforcement and input validation
- **Performance Tests** - Query performance and bulk operation timing
- **Integration Tests** - Cross-doctype workflow validation
- **Unit Tests** - Individual controller method validation

## Compliance Standards
- **SOX Compliance** - Complete audit trails for financial impacts
- **ISO Standards** - Quality management system integration
- **FDA Requirements** - Medical device repair compliance (if applicable)
- **Data Privacy** - PII handling and retention policies
