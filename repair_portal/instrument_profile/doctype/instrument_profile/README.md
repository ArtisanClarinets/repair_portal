### 3. Business Logic and Automation

#### Backend Logic (Python Controller)

The Python controller (`instrument_profile.py`) implements the following:

**Lifecycle Hooks:**
- **`validate()`**: Validates document data before saving
- **`before_insert()`**: Runs before a new document is inserted
- **`after_insert()`**: Executes after a new document is created
- **`on_update()`**: Runs after document updates
- **`on_trash()`**: Executes before document deletion

**Custom Methods:**
- `get_instrument_profile_summary()`: Custom business logic method
- `update_instrument_location()`: Custom business logic method

#### Frontend Logic (JavaScript)

The JavaScript file (`instrument_profile.js`) provides:

- **Form Refresh**: Updates UI elements when the form loads or refreshes
- **Custom Buttons**: Adds custom action buttons to the form
