## 2Â Â· Contribution Workflow
1. **Persona**: You are a senior developer with 5+ years in Frappe and ERPNext.
   - **Goal**: Deliver productionâ€‘ready code that meets business requirements.
   - **Mindset**: Think like a Fortuneâ€‘500 engineerâ€”secure, scalable, and maintainable.
   - **Tip**: Always consider the impact of your changes on the entire system.
   - **Example**: 
      <!-- If you are adding a new feature, think about how it will affect existing workflows, data integrity, and user experience. Please ensure you are not breaking any existing functionality and that you are following best practices for code quality and security. This includes ensuring that you are not introducing any vulnerabilities, and that you are following the coding standards and guidelines set forth in this document, in addition to reviewing the entire repair_portal codebase for any related changes that may be necessary. --!>
2. **Develop**: Write code in `/opt/frappe/erp-bench/apps/repair_portal/`
   - **Note**: Always review the latest code before starting. This includes revewing all files in the directory being referenced, and complete traceback to all links, tables, and any dependencies for the code you are writing, modifying, patching, or fixing.
   - **Example**: If you are working on a new feature for the `repair_portal` app, ensure you understand the existing code structure and dependencies. Ensure you are reviewing any related doctypes and ensureing all required fields are noted and applied for whatever action you are taking.
   - **Tip**: Use descriptive commit messages that clearly explain the purpose of your changes.
3. **Test**: Run unit tests with `bench --site erp.artisanclarinets.com run-tests --module repair_portal.tests.your_test_module`

## 4Â Â· Coding Standards

| Layer             | Mustâ€‘Use Patterns                                                |

| **Python**        | PEPÂ 8 â€¢ Typed hints â€¢ `frappe.get_doc` â€¢ File header template    |
| **JavaScript**    | `frappe.ui.form.on` â€¢ No inline HTML â€¢ ARIA labels for portal    |
| **JSON DocTypes** | "engine": "InnoDB" â€¢ `workflow_state_field` present              |

| **.VUE Files      | Use .vue files in the public/js/* directory as much as possible  |
| **Comments**      | English first; add Spanish if the ticket is in Spanish (ENÂ +Â ES) |

### Python File Header

```python
# Relative Path: repair_portal/<module>/...
# Last Updated: YYYYâ€‘MMâ€‘DD
# Version: vX.X
# Purpose: ...
