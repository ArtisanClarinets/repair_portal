## üöÄ Overview

The **Clarinet Initial Setup** doctype orchestrates, validates, and documents the complete lifecycle of a clarinet‚Äôs first setup. It is used for onboarding new or refurbished clarinets into inventory, tightly integrating with Intake, Instrument, Operations, QA, and Material tracking for a full audit and quality trail.

Automation guarantees:
- Every setup has an Intake link.
- At least one checklist item exists (enforced in both UI and backend).
- All operations must be completed before submission.
- Customer is notified automatically upon QA pass/submit.
- Stock for materials is always validated on save/submit.

## üõ†Ô∏è Backend Logic: `clarinet_initial_setup.py`

### Class: `ClarinetInitialSetup(Document)`

**Purpose:** Enforces end-to-end quality and traceability for clarinet setup workflows, from checklist/operation automation to PDF certification.

#### Methods & Responsibilities:
- **`ensure_checklist(self)`**
  - Appends a default checklist row if none exist (called automatically during automation and insert).
- **`before_insert(self)`**
  - Auto-assigns technician (if missing), ensures checklist integrity.
- **`validate(self)`**
  - Requires intake link; ensures all operations are completed; verifies all materials are in stock; auto-loads operations from template if needed; checklist enforcement.
- **`on_submit(self)`**
  - Auto-creates Material Request for consumed materials.
  - Enqueues PDF certificate creation (`_generate_setup_certificate`).
- **`load_operations_from_template(self)`**
  - Imports default operations from selected Setup Template (if none yet added). Robust error logging.
- **`_generate_setup_certificate(self)`**
  - Generates PDF certificate from setup record and attaches it to the doc (run async via queue).

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Client Script: `clarinet_initial_setup.js`

- **Refresh Event:**
  - Dashboard headline changes based on QA status.
  - Custom buttons:
    - Load Template Operations
    - Attach Work Photos (multi-upload)
    - View Instrument Profile, Job Card, Maintenance Visit (if linked)
  - Real-time updates: reloads doc on WebSocket `doc_update` (if active)
- **Setup Event:**
  - Start Timer button (sets start time, if field present)
- **Validate Event:**
  - Throws error if any operation row is incomplete (before submit)
- **After Save Event:**
  - Notifies customer if setup status is 'Pass' and submitted

---

## üß™ Test Suite: `test_clarinet_initial_setup.py`

- **Stub:**
  - Test class scaffolded for Frappe TestCase integration.
  - Extend with tests for checklist/operation automation, validation, and submission.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security, Compliance & Audit

- Intake link is enforced (no orphaned setups).
- All critical events (submit, validation, automation) log errors using `frappe.log_error()`.
- User actions tracked (changes, seen, views).
- All permissions follow Frappe model: only Technician, Service Manager, System Manager, or Owner (Customer) can create or submit.

---

## üí° Developer Tips & Best Practices

- **Backend:**
  - Add checklist/operations automation in their respective methods to maintain coverage and avoid orphan records.
  - Always use error handling + `frappe.log_error()` in background/async methods.
  - New fields or relationships? Update both JSON, backend, and client-side for full integration.
- **Frontend:**
  - Keep all custom button and event logic inside the correct event handlers (`refresh`, `validate`, `after_save`).
  - Use Frappe FileUploader widget for image attachments.
  - Real-time collaboration (WebSocket) logic is opt-in: test on staging!
- **Testing:**
  - Extend `test_clarinet_initial_setup.py` for every automation or validation rule added.
  - Use fixtures for Template, Instrument, and User in integration tests.
- **PDF Generation:**
  - `_generate_setup_certificate` uses the portal‚Äôs template; test output on each change.
