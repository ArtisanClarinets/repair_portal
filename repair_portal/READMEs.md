## Workflow Consolidation — 2025-07-27

**Major update:**
- Consolidated two overlapping workflow files (`player_profile_workflow.json`, `player_profile_setup.json`) into a single canonical workflow for the `Player Profile` doctype.
- The unified workflow covers the states: Draft → Active → Archived, with all transitions performed by the Repair Manager role only.
- Legacy or non-aligned states such as `Linked to Client` have been removed for clarity and maintainability.
- All forms, reports, and automations now reference only the official workflow states, matching the select field options.

> This change reduces confusion, prevents workflow collisions, and aligns player profile lifecycle with Frappe/ERPNext best practices.

**Do not** commit this to version control.

See [the docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/cache.html) for more information.
# Instrument Photo (Child Table)

## Purpose
This child table stores all photo/image records linked to an instrument's lifecycle:
- **Hero/Profile Image**
- **Marketing Photo Gallery**
- **Service Photo Log**

## Fields
- `photo` (Attach Image): Filepath or uploaded image.
- `category` (Select): e.g., 'Hero', 'Marketing', 'Service Before', 'Service After', etc.
- `description` (Data/Text): Context for the image.
- `timestamp` (Datetime): When photo was taken/added.
- `uploaded_by` (Link: User): Staff who uploaded.

## Usage
- Photos are attached at inspection, intake, and during repairs or marketing events.
- Media is referenced in both the Instrument Inspection and Instrument Profile doctypes.

## Compliance
- Only users with instrument edit rights can add/delete.
- Media is retained as part of the instrument’s permanent record for provenance and analytics.
# Instrument Accessory (Child Table)

## Purpose
Captures all accessories currently paired or historically associated with an instrument profile:
- Original case, barrels, bell, mouthpiece
- Aftermarket or upgraded parts (e.g., custom barrels, bells, ligatures, etc.)
- Accessory logs are used for sales bundles, service reference, and provenance.

## Fields
- `item` (Data): Accessory type/name (e.g., Case, Barrel, Bell).
- `desc` (Text): Detailed description (e.g., "BAM Trekking Case", "Fobes Debut 66mm Barrel").
- `serial_no` (Optional, Data): Serial/ID if present (for tracking unique accessories).
- `acquired_date` (Date): When added to instrument.
- `removed_date` (Date): If/when it left the instrument's profile.
- `current` (Check): If it is currently with the instrument.


# Instrument Profile — Materialized Snapshot

**Goal:** Make `Instrument Profile` a single, reliable “snapshot” of an instrument.  
It synchronizes canonical identity fields from related doctypes and exposes an API that returns
a full aggregated view (owner, serial record, accessories, media, condition history, interactions).

---

## How it works

### 1) Service Layer
File: `repair_portal/instrument_profile/services/profile_sync.py`

- `sync_now(profile=None, instrument=None)`  
  Ensures the profile exists and updates scalar fields on `Instrument Profile` from canonical sources.

- `get_snapshot(instrument=None, profile=None)`  
  Returns a **full aggregated dictionary** including:
  - `instrument` (selected fields from Instrument, discovered from live schema)
  - `owner` (Customer)
  - `serial_record` (Instrument Serial Number)
  - `accessories` (list) — if `Instrument Accessory` exists
  - `media` (list) — if `Instrument Media` exists
  - `conditions` (list) — if `Instrument Condition Record` exists
  - `interactions` (list) — if `Instrument Interaction Log` exists
  - `headline` and `profile_name`

> **Schema-safe selectors**: The service inspects DocType metadata to only select columns that actually exist on your site.  
> Ordering also auto-falls back to `creation desc` if a preferred order field isn’t present.  
> This eliminates SQL errors like `Unknown column 'accessory_type' in 'SELECT'`.

### 2) Controller
File: `repair_portal/instrument_profile/doctype/instrument_profile/instrument_profile.py`

- Treats key identity/ownership fields as **read-only** (managed by the service).
- Triggers a sync on insert/update (with guards to avoid loops).

### 3) Client (Form UI)
File: `repair_portal/instrument_profile/doctype/instrument_profile/instrument_profile.js`

- Adds a **“Sync Now”** button on the Profile form.
- Shows warranty/status indicators on the dashboard.

### 4) Hooks for Auto-Sync
Add this block (merge with your `doc_events`) in `repair_portal/hooks.py`:

```python
doc_events = globals().get("doc_events", {}) or {}

doc_events.update({
    "Instrument": {
        "after_insert": "repair_portal.instrument_profile.services.profile_sync.on_linked_doc_change",
        "on_update": "repair_portal.instrument_profile.services.profile_sync.on_linked_doc_change",
        "on_change": "repair_portal.instrument_profile.services.profile_sync.on_linked_doc_change",
    },
    "Instrument Serial Number": {
        "on_update": "repair_portal.instrument_profile.services.profile_sync.on_linked_doc_change",
    },
    # Optional if present in your site:
    "Instrument Condition Record": {
        "after_insert": "repair_portal.instrument_profile.services.profile_sync.on_linked_doc_change",
        "on_update": "repair_portal.instrument_profile.services.profile_sync.on_linked_doc_change",
        "on_trash": "repair_portal.instrument_profile.services.profile_sync.on_linked_doc_change",
    },
    "Instrument Media": {
        "after_insert": "repair_portal.instrument_profile.services.profile_sync.on_linked_doc_change",
        "on_trash": "repair_portal.instrument_profile.services.profile_sync.on_linked_doc_change",
    },
    "Instrument Interaction Log": {
        "after_insert": "repair_portal.instrument_profile.services.profile_sync.on_linked_doc_change",
        "on_trash": "repair_portal.instrument_profile.services.profile_sync.on_linked_doc_change",
    },
})

# Loaner Return Check (`loaner_return_check`)

## Purpose
The Loaner Return Check DocType records the inspection of a loaner instrument when it is returned by a customer. It ensures that return condition, photos, and notes are documented and helps enforce accountability for damages.

## Schema Summary
- **DocType Type:** Standard (not Single, not Child)
- **Key Fields:**
  - `linked_loaner` (Link → Loaner Instrument, Required): Reference to the issued loaner
  - `condition_notes` (Text): Notes about condition upon return
  - `return_photos` (Attach Image): Photos documenting return state
  - `damage_found` (Check): Whether damage was observed
  - `return_date` (Date): When instrument was returned
  - `workflow_state` (Link → Workflow State, Read Only): Tracks workflow stage

## Business Rules
- Each return check must be linked to an existing Loaner Instrument.
- If `damage_found` is checked, `condition_notes` must be provided.
- Photos can be attached to strengthen documentation and accountability.
- Workflow integration allows for escalation (e.g., Damage Review).

## Python Controller Logic
File: `loaner_return_check.py`

- **Class:** `LoanerReturnCheck(Document)`
- **Methods:**
  - `validate()`: Ensures notes are included if damage is flagged.

### Example Logic
```python
if self.damage_found and not self.condition_notes:
    frappe.throw("Please include condition notes when damage is flagged.")
```

## Client-Side Script
- None currently.
- Possible enhancements:
  - Auto-prompt to attach photos if `damage_found` is checked.
  - Dashboard status indicator when return check is pending.

## Integration Points
- **Loaner Instrument**: Linked via `linked_loaner`
- **Workflow**: Uses `workflow_state` for tracking return process
- **Customer**: Permissions allow owner-submitted return confirmations

## Validation Standards
- `linked_loaner`: Required
- `damage_found`: Requires condition notes
- `return_date`: Recommended to be provided at time of return

## Usage Examples
- **Normal Return:**  
  `linked_loaner: LN-2025-001, damage_found: 0, condition_notes: "No issues observed", return_date: 2025-08-16`
- **Damaged Return:**  
  `linked_loaner: LN-2025-002, damage_found: 1, condition_notes: "Crack in lower joint", return_photos: attached`

## Changelog
- **2025-08-16**: Documentation created.
- **2025-06-12**: Validation logic requiring notes when damage flagged was added.

## Dependencies
- **Frappe Framework**
- **Loaner Instrument (linked doctype)**

## Purpose
The Brand Mapping Rule DocType defines how external or alternate brand names are mapped to standardized brand identifiers within the Repair Portal. This ensures consistency in intake processing, reporting, and instrument profile linkage.

## Schema Summary
- **Naming:** Auto-assigned (system managed)
- **DocType Type:** Child Table (`istable: 1`)
- **Key Fields:**
  - `from_brand` (Data, Required): Original brand name (e.g., "Buffet-Crampon Paris")
  - `to_brand` (Data, Required): Standardized mapped brand (e.g., "Buffet")

## Business Rules
- Each mapping links one external brand name to a standardized brand.
- Duplicate mappings are not allowed; each `(from_brand, to_brand)` pair must be unique.
- Used in intake workflows to automatically normalize brand values.

## Python Controller Logic
File: `brand_mapping_rule.py`

- **Class:** `BrandMappingRule(Document)`
- **Methods:**
  - `validate()`: Ensures that `from_brand` and `to_brand` are provided and calls duplicate-check.
  - `validate_unique_mapping()`: Prevents saving if the same mapping already exists.

### Example Logic
```python
if not self.from_brand:
    frappe.throw("From Brand is required")

if not self.to_brand:
    frappe.throw("To Brand is required")

if frappe.db.exists("Brand Mapping Rule", {
    "from_brand": self.from_brand,
    "to_brand": self.to_brand,
    "name": ["!=", self.name],
}):
    frappe.throw(f"A mapping from '{self.from_brand}' to '{self.to_brand}' already exists.")
```

## Client-Side Script
- No JavaScript controller currently exists.
- Potential enhancements:
  - Auto-suggest known brands when typing `from_brand`.
  - Validation warning if `from_brand` and `to_brand` are identical.

## Integration Points
- **Clarinet Intake**: Ensures brand normalization when new instruments are logged.
- **Reports**: Provides standardized brand names for consistent analytics.
- **Inventory**: Maps alternate names to unified brand references.

## Validation Standards
- `from_brand`: Required, non-empty string.
- `to_brand`: Required, non-empty string.
- Duplicate `(from_brand, to_brand)` pairs not allowed.

## Usage Examples
- `from_brand: Buffet-Crampon Paris → to_brand: Buffet`
- `from_brand: Selmer USA → to_brand: Selmer`

## Changelog
- **2025-08-16**: Initial documentation created for schema, logic, and usage.

## Dependencies
- **Frappe Framework**: Child table validation and uniqueness enforcement.
- **Parent DocType**: Used inside Clarinet Intake and related intake doctypes.# Loaner Instrument (`loaner_instrument`)

## Purpose
The Loaner Instrument DocType manages instruments temporarily issued to customers while their own instrument is under repair. It tracks issuance, expected return dates, and automatically generates digital loaner agreements.

## Schema Summary
- **DocType Type:** Submittable
- **Workflow States:** Controlled by `loaner_status`
  - `Issued` → Default on creation
  - `Returned` → Marked when instrument is returned
  - `Overdue` → System or user can flag overdue returns
- **Key Fields:**
  - `loaner_serial` (Data, Required): Unique loaner serial number
  - `item_code` (Link → Item): ERPNext Item reference
  - `issued_to` (Link → Customer): Customer borrowing the instrument
  - `issued_date` (Date, Required): Loaner start date
  - `expected_return_date` (Date): Anticipated return date
  - `returned` (Check): Boolean toggle when instrument returned
  - `loaner_status` (Select): Status field (Issued, Returned, Overdue)

## Business Rules
- Loaner instruments must have a unique `loaner_serial`.
- PDF agreements are automatically generated when an instrument is issued.
- Returned instruments must toggle the `returned` checkbox and set `loaner_status` to Returned.
- Overdue instruments should be monitored for follow-up actions.

## Python Controller Logic
File: `loaner_instrument.py`

- **Class:** `LoanerInstrument(Document)`
- **Hooks:**
  - `after_insert()`: Automatically generates loaner agreement if instrument is issued.
- **Methods:**
  - `generate_loaner_agreement()`: Creates a PDF contract and attaches to the document.

### Example Logic
```python
context = {"doc": self, "customer": frappe.get_doc("Customer", self.issued_to)}
html = render_template("repair_portal/intake/templates/loaner_agreement_template.html", context)
pdf = get_pdf(html)
filename = f"LoanerAgreement_{self.name}.pdf"
save_file(filename, pdf, self.doctype, self.name, is_private=1)
```

**Error Handling:**
- Logs traceback with `frappe.log_error()`.
- User notified: `"There was an error generating the loaner agreement PDF. Please contact support."`

## Client-Side Script
- None currently.
- Potential enhancements:
  - Dashboard indicator for overdue instruments.
  - Auto-popup to confirm loaner return.

## Integration Points
- **Customer**: Loaner is linked to a customer record.
- **Item**: Each loaner references an Item master.
- **PDF Templates**: Uses Jinja2 loaner agreement template for contract generation.
- **File Manager**: Stores loaner agreement as a private file.

## Validation Standards
- `loaner_serial`: Required, must be unique.
- `issued_date`: Required.
- `loaner_status`: Must be one of Issued, Returned, Overdue.
- PDF generation errors are logged for audit.

## Usage Examples
- **New Loaner Issue:**  
  `loaner_serial: LN-2025-001, issued_to: John Doe, issued_date: 2025-08-16, expected_return_date: 2025-09-01, loaner_status: Issued`  
  → Auto-generates loaner agreement.
- **Return Processing:**  
  Mark `returned = 1`, update `loaner_status = Returned`.

## Changelog
- **2025-08-16**: Documentation created.
- **2025-07-17**: Added PDF auto-generation with robust error handling.

## Dependencies
- **Frappe Framework**
- **ERPNext Item**
- **Customer**
- **File Manager** (for PDF storage)
- **Jinja2 Templates**# Intake Accessory Item (`intake_accessory_item`)

## Purpose

- Each row represents one type of accessory with quantity and notes.
- Zero quantity is allowed but generates a user-facing warning.
- Negative quantities are strictly disallowed.

## Python Controller Logic
File: `intake_accessory_item.py`

- **Class:** `IntakeAccessoryItem(Document)`
- **Methods:**
  - `validate()`: Ensures accessory description is provided and quantity is valid.

### Example Logic
```python
if not self.accessory:
    frappe.throw("Accessory description cannot be empty.")

if self.quantity is None:
    self.quantity = 1

if self.quantity < 0:
    frappe.throw("Quantity cannot be negative.")

if self.quantity == 0:
    frappe.msgprint("Warning: Quantity is set to zero. Consider updating if this is unintended.")
```

## Client-Side Script
- None currently.

  - Auto-default notes field with condition templates.

## Integration Points
- **Clarinet Intake:** Parent document, accessories are attached as child records.
- **Inventory Tracking:** Provides context for accessory inclusion during intake.
- **Customer Communication:** Notes may be included in intake reports.

## Validation Standards
- `accessory`: Required, must be descriptive.
- `quantity`: Must be a non-negative integer.
- `notes`: Optional free-text field.

## Usage Examples
- `accessory: Case, quantity: 1`
- `accessory: Reeds, quantity: 10, notes: Vandoren size 3`
- `accessory: Mouthpiece Cap, quantity: 0 (warns user)`

## Changelog
- **2025-08-16**: Initial documentation created.

## Dependencies
- **Frappe Framework**
- **Clarinet Intake (parent doctype)**# Clarinet Intake Settings (`clarinet_intake_settings`)

## Purpose
The Clarinet Intake Settings DocType provides centralized configuration for all Clarinet Intake workflows. It defines default warehouses, item groups, pricing, naming series, and automation behaviors used when instruments are processed.

## Schema Summary
- **DocType Type:** Single (issingle = 1)
- **Key Sections:**
  - **Defaults:**
    - `default_item_group`: Default Item Group for intake-created items (default: "Clarinets")
    - `default_inspection_warehouse`: Warehouse used for inspections
    - `buying_price_list`: Price List for procurement (default: "Standard Buying")
    - `selling_price_list`: Price List for sales (default: "Standard Selling")
    - `stock_uom`: Default UOM for stock entries (default: "Nos")
  - **Automation & Behavior:**
    - `require_inspection`: Enforce creation of inspection on intake (default: enabled)
    - `auto_create_initial_setup`: Automatically generate Clarinet Initial Setup for new inventory
    - `notify_on_stock_issue`: Notify users when stock problems occur
  - **Labels & Mapping:**
    - `inspection_type_inventory`: Label for inventory inspections (default: "Initial Inspection")
    - `inspection_type_repair`: Label for repair inspections (default: "Arrival Inspection")
    - `supplier_code_prefix`: Optional prefix for supplier coding
    - `intake_naming_series`: Naming series for intake records (default: "INV-.#####")
    - `brand_mapping_rules`: Child table of **Brand Mapping Rule**

## Business Rules
- All intake-related automation reads from this configuration.
- Enforced by controllers in `clarinet_intake.py` and other intake doctypes.
- Any changes take effect immediately across the system.

## Python Controller Logic
File: `clarinet_intake_settings.py`

- **Class:** `ClarinetIntakeSettings(Document)`
  - Minimal controller; inherits core Frappe validation.
- **Utility:**
  ```python
  def get_intake_settings():
      """Returns Clarinet Intake Settings as a dict."""
      return frappe.get_single("Clarinet Intake Settings").as_dict()
  ```
  Used by other doctypes to fetch settings in a single call.

## Client-Side Script
- None (settings are managed directly in the form).

## Integration Points
- **Clarinet Intake**: Uses defaults for warehouse, pricing, and automation.
- **Instrument Inspection**: Driven by `require_inspection` and inspection type fields.
- **Clarinet Initial Setup**: Created automatically if `auto_create_initial_setup` is enabled.
- **Brand Mapping Rule**: Linked table for normalizing brand names.

## Validation Standards
- `default_item_group` must reference an existing Item Group.
- `default_inspection_warehouse` must reference a valid Warehouse.
- Naming series must conform to Frappe format rules.
- Child table `brand_mapping_rules` enforces uniqueness of brand mappings.

## Usage Examples
- **New Inventory Intake:**  
  Automatically applies `default_item_group`, sets warehouse to `default_inspection_warehouse`, and creates Initial Setup if enabled.
- **Repair Intake:**  
  Inspection is auto-created using the `inspection_type_repair` label.

## Changelog
- **2025-08-16**: Documentation created with schema, business rules, and integration details.

## Dependencies
- **Frappe Framework**
- **Brand Mapping Rule (child table)**
- **Clarinet Intake** (consumes settings)
- **Instrument Inspection**
- **Clarinet Initial Setup**# Clarinet Intake (`clarinet_intake`)

## Purpose
The Clarinet Intake DocType records all instrument intake events, whether for new inventory, repair, or maintenance. It acts as the central hub for instrument registration, customer communication, inspection, and workflow initiation.

## Schema Summary
- **Naming:** Auto-assigned via `intake_record_id` (naming series)
- **DocType Type:** Submittable
- **Workflow States:** Pending → Received → Inspection → Setup → Repair → Awaiting Approval → Awaiting Payment → In Transit → Repair Complete → Returned
- **Key Fields:**
  - Instrument Metadata: `instrument_category`, `manufacturer`, `model`, `serial_no`, `clarinet_type`
  - Customer Info: `customer`, `customer_full_name`, `customer_phone`, `customer_email`, `customer_type`
  - Technical Assessments: `wood_body_condition`, `keywork_condition`, `pad_condition`, `spring_condition`, `cork_condition`
  - Service Request: `service_type_requested`, `estimated_cost`, `deposit_paid`, `customer_approval`, `promised_completion_date`
  - Acquisition Data: `acquisition_source`, `acquisition_cost`, `store_asking_price`
  - Attachments: `initial_intake_photos`, `consent_form`
  - Accessories: Child table `Instrument Accessory`

## Business Rules
- Intake type determines required fields:
  - **New Inventory:** Requires `item_code`, `item_name`, `acquisition_cost`, `store_asking_price`
  - **Repair / Maintenance:** Requires `customer`, `customers_stated_issue`
- Each intake auto-generates:
  - **Instrument Serial Number (custom doctype)**
  - **Instrument** record if not already existing
  - **Instrument Inspection** record linked to intake
  - **Clarinet Initial Setup** (for new inventory, if enabled in settings)
- Duplicate serials are prevented by using the ISN utility functions.

## Python Controller Logic
File: `clarinet_intake.py`

- **Class:** `ClarinetIntake(Document)`
- **Hooks:**
  - `after_insert()` → orchestrates item, instrument, ISN, inspection, and setup creation.
  - `autoname()` → generates naming series.
  - `validate()` → enforces dynamic mandatory fields and auto-syncs instrument data.
- **Helpers:**
  - `_compute_inspection_serial_value()` → Handles legacy vs. modern serial link types.
  - `_find_existing_instrument_by_serial()` → Fetches existing instrument by ISN or raw serial.
  - `_sync_info_from_existing_instrument()` → Auto-populates instrument/manufacturer/model fields.
- **Whitelisted Functions:**
  - `get_instrument_by_serial(serial_no)` → returns Instrument metadata.
  - `get_instrument_inspection_name(intake_record_id)` → fetches inspection linked to intake.

## Client-Side Script
File: `clarinet_intake.js`

- **Custom Buttons:**
  - **Settings** → Directs to Clarinet Intake Settings.
  - **Instrument Inspection** → Quick link if inspection exists.
  - **Initial Setup** → Quick link if setup exists for new inventory.
- **Dynamic Required Fields:**  
  Toggles mandatory fields based on `intake_type`.
- **Serial Autofill:**  
  Auto-fills form data when serial is entered, via `get_instrument_by_serial`.

## Integration Points
- **ERPNext Item**: Auto-created for new inventory.
- **Instrument Serial Number**: Centralized tracking.
- **Instrument**: Linked or created per intake.
- **Instrument Inspection**: Automatically linked.
- **Clarinet Initial Setup**: Created for new inventory workflows.
- **Clarinet Intake Settings**: Provides default values, item groups, and automation toggles.

## Validation Standards
- `intake_type`: Must be valid selection (New Inventory, Repair, Maintenance).
- Dynamic field validation per intake type.
- Serial number uniqueness enforced via ISN utilities.
- Customer information mandatory for repairs and maintenance.

## Usage Examples
- **New Inventory:**  
  Intake logs a new Buffet clarinet with auto-created Item, ISN, Instrument, Inspection, and Initial Setup.
- **Repair:**  
  Intake records customer-reported issue, creates inspection, links to existing instrument if serial already known.

## Changelog
- **2025-08-16**: Documentation updated with schema, logic, and integration details.
- **2025-08-14**: Controller updated for robust ISN handling and legacy compatibility.

**Location:** `repair_portal/intake/`

## Overview
The Intake module orchestrates the full lifecycle of instrument and accessory intake, service initiation, and tracking for clarinet and related assets. It is the first touchpoint for inventory, customer drop-offs, and repair workflows, ensuring every asset and action is logged, validated, and fully traceable.

---

## Main Components

- **Doctypes:**
  - **Clarinet Intake:** The master record for every intake (inventory, customer, repair). Handles workflow, ownership, linkage to setups, and downstream automation.
  - **Loaner Instrument:** Manages assignment, agreement PDF, and lifecycle of loaner assets. Auto-generates agreements and logs error reliably.
  - **Accessory Items, Checklists, Return Checks, Consent Forms:** All structured as doctypes, modular for asset/accessory traceability and compliance.

- **Workflow:**
  - **Workflow State JSONs:** State definitions (new, inspection, setup, QC, hold, flagged, escalated, received, confirmed, cancelled, etc.) in `/workflow_state/` folders.
  - **Transitions:** Automated and manual, enforced via Frappe workflow engine. Supports portal and internal review.
  - **Tested:** Workflow state test stub present for validation and CI.

- **Automation & Controllers:**
  - **Python controllers** for all core doctypes.
  - Automated linking of setups, logs, service/repair, and QA events to intakes and instrument profiles.
  - Loaner agreement generation robustly error-handled (`frappe.log_error`).

- **Reports & Dashboards:**
  - **Operational Reports:** Loaners outstanding, loaner turnover, intake by day, follow-up compliance, upcoming appointments, deposit balance aging, loaner return flags. All in `/report/` folders with JSON+Python.
  - **Dashboard Charts:** Appointments by week, overdue intakes, intakes due soon, average intake-to-repair, loaners checked out—all JSON-based, ready for dashboard plug-and-play.

- **Print Formats:**
  - All forms and receipts for intake and loaner workflows, under `/print_format/` (e.g., intake receipt).

- **Web Forms:**
  - Portal-ready intake request web form for customer-initiated intake events.

- **Config & Utilities:**
  - Desktop icon configs, workflow definition helpers, and email utilities for notifications (e.g., `/utils/emailer.py`).

- **Testing:**
  - `/test/` folder contains full-flow intake tests and new workflow transition stub.

- **Automation Scripts & Hooks:**
  - **Hooks:** Event hooks for workflow reloading, compliance automation, and error logging. All scripts follow best-practice for Frappe v15 and auditability.
  - **Migration Helpers:** Scripts to reload/sanitize doctypes, fix workflows, and seed QC/QA data (in `/scripts/hooks/`).

- **Compliance & Quality:**
  - PEP 8, Fortune-500 polish, robust docstrings and inline comments.
  - Every major action wrapped in try/except with `frappe.log_error` for bulletproof auditing.
  - Change history is maintained at the project root (`CHANGELOG.md`).

---

## How Everything Connects

- **Inventory Intake:**
  - Triggers creation and linking of initial setup, logs, and instrument profile.
  - Automated workflow and field validation ensure data integrity.

- **Loaner Issuance:**
  - Customer/asset linked, agreement PDF generated, document attached.
  - On failure, errors are logged and surfaced with actionable messages.

- **Customer Portal:**
  - Role-based permissioning: customers only see their intakes; internal users manage the full lifecycle.

- **Reporting & Dashboarding:**
  - All intake, loaner, and compliance activity is visible in operational dashboards and reports—enterprise ready.

---

## Extension & Maintenance

- Add new workflow states, doctypes, or automation scripts as your processes grow.
- Test files are modular—expand for deeper workflow or permissions coverage.
- Use migration and fix scripts to keep all metadata 100% v15 compatible and audit-safe.

---

## For More Info
- See `/repair_portal/CHANGELOG.md` for full historical updates.
- Each doctype and script contains its own header for traceability.

---

**This module is architected for transparency, compliance, and enterprise scale—no technical debt, no silos, and robust error logging at every step.**
Programmatic usage (anywhere in Python)
You (or other server code) can generate a certificate for any setup with:

python
Copy code
doc = frappe.get_doc("Clarinet Initial Setup", "<SETUP_NAME>")
result = doc.generate_certificate(print_format="Clarinet Setup Certificate", attach=1, return_file_url=1)

# result => {"file_url": "...", "file_name": "..."}

If you prefer raw control (exactly what you pasted earlier), the equivalent low-level snippet is:

python
Copy code
html = frappe.get_print("Clarinet Initial Setup", doc.name, "Clarinet Setup Certificate")
pdf = frappe.utils.pdf.get_pdf(html)

# optionally save/attach:

frappe.utils.file_manager.save_file(f"{doc.name} - Setup Certificate.pdf", pdf, doc.doctype, doc.name, is_private=1)
# Setup Material Log (`setup_material_log`)

## Purpose
The Clarinet Template Task Depends On DocType defines prerequisite relationships within setup templates, establishing which template tasks must be completed before others can begin. This ensures proper sequencing in complex setup workflows and prevents tasks from starting before their dependencies are satisfied.

## Schema Summary
- **Naming:** Auto-assigned (system managed)
- **Parent Integration:** Child table of Clarinet Template Task
- **Key Fields:**
  - `task` (Link): Reference to prerequisite Clarinet Template Task (required)
  - `parent` (Link): Parent Clarinet Template Task that depends on this prerequisite
  - `parenttype` (Data): Always "Clarinet Template Task" (system managed)
  - `parentfield` (Data): Always "depends_on" (system managed)

## Business Rules

### Dependency Logic
- **Prerequisite Validation**: Referenced task must exist and be part of the same template
- **Circular Prevention**: System prevents creating circular dependency chains
- **Sequence Enforcement**: Dependencies create implicit ordering in task execution
- **Template Propagation**: When templates are applied, these dependencies become actual task dependencies

### Relationship Requirements
- Parent task cannot depend on itself (self-reference prevention)
- All dependency tasks must belong to the same Setup Template
- Dependencies cannot span across different templates
- At least one dependency required if depends_on table is populated

## Data Structure

### Required Fields
- **`task`**: Must reference valid Clarinet Template Task
  - Enforced by Link field validation
  - Must exist in the same system
  - Cannot reference the parent task (circular prevention)

### System-Managed Fields
- **`parent`**: Automatically populated by Frappe framework
- **`parenttype`**: Always "Clarinet Template Task"
- **`parentfield`**: Always "depends_on"
- **`name`**: Auto-generated unique identifier

## Integration Points

### Template System Integration
- **Template Application**: Dependencies copied to actual Clarinet Setup Tasks when template is applied
- **Sequence Planning**: Used to calculate optimal task ordering in Gantt charts
- **Validation**: Prevents template activation if dependency chains are invalid

### Task Management Integration  
- **Status Gating**: Real tasks inherit these dependencies and cannot start until prerequisites are Complete
- **Progress Calculation**: Dependencies affect overall template progress calculation
- **Visual Representation**: Dependencies shown in task relationship diagrams

## Business Logic Implementation

### Validation Rules
Templates validate dependency relationships during save:
- No circular dependencies (A→B→A chains)
- All referenced tasks exist in the same template
- Dependencies point to valid Clarinet Template Task records
- Parent task exists and is valid

### Propagation Logic
When Setup Template is applied to create Clarinet Initial Setup:
1. Template tasks become Clarinet Setup Tasks
2. Template dependencies become Clarinet Task Depends On entries  
3. Original dependency relationships preserved in new task structure
4. Status enforcement begins immediately for real tasks

## Data Integrity

### Referential Integrity
- **Task Link**: Must reference existing Clarinet Template Task
- **Parent Relationship**: Maintained by Frappe's child table system
- **Template Scope**: All dependencies scoped to single template

### Cleanup Rules
- **Task Deletion**: If referenced task is deleted, dependency is automatically removed
- **Parent Deletion**: If parent task is deleted, all its dependencies are removed
- **Template Deletion**: All dependencies removed when template is deleted

## Usage Examples

### Linear Dependencies
```
Task A: "Inspect Instrument"
Task B: "Clean Components" (depends on A)
Task C: "Replace Pads" (depends on B) 
Task D: "Final Testing" (depends on C)
```

### Parallel Dependencies
```
Task A: "Disassemble Instrument" 
Task B: "Clean Upper Joint" (depends on A)
Task C: "Clean Lower Joint" (depends on A)
Task D: "Reassemble" (depends on B, C)
```

### Complex Dependencies
```
Task A: "Initial Inspection"
Task B: "Pad Assessment" (depends on A)
Task C: "Spring Assessment" (depends on A) 
Task D: "Replace Pads" (depends on B)
Task E: "Adjust Springs" (depends on C)
Task F: "Final Testing" (depends on D, E)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- Dependencies loaded efficiently with parent tasks
- Bulk operations for template application
- Indexed relationships for fast dependency lookups

### Memory Usage
- Lightweight records with minimal data storage
- Efficient relationship representation
- Quick validation checks during task operations

## Error Handling

### Common Validation Errors
- **Circular Dependency**: "Cannot create circular dependency chain"
- **Invalid Task Reference**: "Referenced task does not exist"
- **Cross-Template Reference**: "Dependencies must be within same template"
- **Self-Reference**: "Task cannot depend on itself"

### Recovery Mechanisms
- Automatic cleanup on task deletion
- Validation repair during template save
- Dependency resolution during template application

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- Test circular dependency prevention
- Test valid dependency creation and deletion
- Test cross-template reference prevention
- Test propagation to real tasks

### Integration Tests
- Test template application with complex dependencies
- Test task execution with dependency gating
- Test progress calculation with dependency chains
- Test cleanup on parent task deletion

### Workflow Tests  
- Test complete setup workflow with dependencies
- Test dependency resolution in UI
- Test error handling for invalid dependencies
- Test performance with large dependency networks

## Changelog
- **2025-08-16**: Created DocType for template dependency management
- **Initial**: Basic dependency relationship structure

## Dependencies
- **Frappe Framework**: Child table management, referential integrity
- **Parent DocType**: Clarinet Template Task (contains dependency definitions)
- **Referenced DocType**: Clarinet Template Task (prerequisite tasks)
- **Propagation Target**: Clarinet Task Depends On (runtime dependency implementation)
# Clarinet Pad Map (`clarinet_pad_map`)

## Purpose
The Clarinet Pad Map DocType creates and manages standardized pad layout templates for different clarinet types (Soprano, Bass, Contrabass). It automatically generates comprehensive pad configurations based on instrument family and variant, enabling technicians to have consistent setup references and ensuring all pads are properly addressed during setup and maintenance.

## Schema Summary
- **Naming:** `autoname: "format:PAD-MAP-{clarinet_model}"` (e.g., PAD-MAP-Bb Soprano)
- **Key Fields:**
  - `clarinet_model` (Data): Model identifier (required) - becomes part of naming
  - `clarinet_family` (Select): Instrument family (Soprano, Bass, Contrabass)
  - `clarinet_variant` (Select): Model variant (Standard, Professional, Student)
  - `total_pads` (Int): Total number of pads in the layout (read-only, calculated)
  - `description` (Text): Map purpose and usage notes
  - `is_active` (Check): Whether this map is currently in use (defaults to 1)
- **Pad Layout:**
  - `pad_entries` (Table): Child table of individual pad specifications
  - Each entry contains position, size, material, and configuration details
- **Metadata:**
  - `created_date` (Date): When the map was created
  - `last_updated` (Datetime): Last modification timestamp

## Business Rules

### Automatic Pad Generation
The system automatically populates pad entries based on the clarinet family:

#### Soprano Clarinet Layout
- **Upper Joint**: G#, A, A#, B, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A (13 pads)
- **Lower Joint**: B, C, C#, D, E♭, E, F (7 pads)
- **Bell**: F# (1 pad)
- **Total**: 21 pads standard for soprano instruments

#### Bass Clarinet Layout  
- **Upper Joint**: G#, A, A#, B, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A (13 pads)
- **Lower Joint**: B, C, C#, D, E♭, E, F, G, A (9 pads)
- **Bell**: F#, G# (2 pads)
- **Additional**: Low E♭, Low D, Low C (extended range pads)
- **Total**: 27 pads for standard bass clarinet

### Pad Configuration Rules
- **Open vs. Closed**: Each pad is marked as naturally open or closed
- **Material Standards**: Cork, felt, or synthetic materials based on position
- **Size Specifications**: Diameter measurements for replacement ordering
- **Position Mapping**: Joint location and fingering correlation

### Validation Logic
- Model name must be unique within active maps
- Clarinet family must be selected for auto-population
- Pad entries cannot be manually added during auto-population
- Total pad count is calculated automatically and read-only

## Server Logic (`clarinet_pad_map.py`)

### Lifecycle Hooks

1. **`before_save()`**:
   - **Auto-population Trigger**: Calls `populate_pad_entries()` if pad_entries is empty
   - **Pad Count Update**: Recalculates `total_pads` from child table length
   - **Timestamp Management**: Updates `last_updated` field

2. **`validate()`**:
   - **Model Validation**: Ensures clarinet_model is provided and valid
   - **Family Consistency**: Validates family/variant combinations make sense
   - **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents multiple active maps for same model

### Auto-population System

**`populate_pad_entries()`**: Main orchestration method
- Determines clarinet family from the model name or family field
- Routes to family-specific population methods
- Handles error cases where family cannot be determined
- Updates total_pads count after population

**`populate_soprano_pads()`**: Soprano-specific pad layout
```python
pads = [
    # Upper Joint - 13 pads
    {"pad_position": "G# (Upper)", "joint": "Upper Joint", "is_open_key": 0, "material": "Cork", "diameter_mm": 12.5},
    {"pad_position": "A (Upper)", "joint": "Upper Joint", "is_open_key": 0, "material": "Cork", "diameter_mm": 13.0},
    # ... continues with complete upper joint layout
    
    # Lower Joint - 7 pads  
    {"pad_position": "B (Lower)", "joint": "Lower Joint", "is_open_key": 1, "material": "Felt", "diameter_mm": 15.0},
    # ... continues with lower joint layout
    
    # Bell - 1 pad
    {"pad_position": "F# (Bell)", "joint": "Bell", "is_open_key": 0, "material": "Cork", "diameter_mm": 11.0}
]
```

**`populate_bass_pads()`**: Bass clarinet extended layout
- Includes all soprano pads plus extended range
- Adds Low E♭, Low D, Low C for extended range instruments
- Larger pad diameters for bass instrument scale
- Additional bell pads for bass clarinet acoustics

**`populate_contrabass_pads()`**: Contrabass ultra-extended layout
- Most comprehensive pad set with lowest range extensions
- Includes all bass clarinet pads plus additional low notes
- Extra-large pad specifications for contrabass scale

### Family Detection Logic
**`determine_clarinet_family()`**: Intelligent family detection
- Checks explicit `clarinet_family` field first
- Falls back to model name parsing for keywords:
  - "Bass" or "bass" → Bass
  - "Contrabass" or "contrabass" → Contrabass
  - Default → Soprano
- Case-insensitive matching for robust detection

## Client Logic (`clarinet_pad_map.js`)

### Form Events
1. **`refresh(frm)`**:
   - **Status Display**: Shows active/inactive status in dashboard
   - **Action Buttons**: Provides "Regenerate Pad Layout" button for maintenance
   - **Info Display**: Shows total pad count and last updated information

2. **`onload(frm)`**:
   - **Auto-population Check**: Triggers pad generation if entries are empty
   - **Model Focus**: Sets cursor to clarinet_model field for new documents

3. **`clarinet_model(frm)`**:
   - **Change Handler**: Triggers pad regeneration when model changes
   - **Family Detection**: Updates family field based on model name
   - **Validation**: Prevents duplicate model names

### Action Buttons
- **"Regenerate Pad Layout"**: 
  - Clears existing pad entries
  - Triggers auto-population based on current family
  - Shows progress indicator during regeneration
  - Refreshes form to display new layout

### UI Enhancements
- **Dashboard Indicators**: Shows active status and pad count summary
- **Color Coding**: Active maps displayed with green indicator
- **Quick Actions**: Easy access to regeneration and status toggle
- **Progress Feedback**: Loading states during pad generation

# Setup Template (`setup_template`)

## Purpose
The Setup Template DocType serves as a project template system for standardizing clarinet setup processes. It mirrors ERPNext's Project Template functionality, allowing technicians to create reusable templates with predefined tasks, operations, and cost estimates that can be applied to individual Clarinet Initial Setup projects.

## Schema Summary

### Identification & Basic Info
- **Naming:** `naming_series` = "ST-.YYYY.-.####"
- **template_id:** Unique identifier for the template (auto-generated)
- **template_name:** Human-readable name for the template
- **setup_type:** Select field (Standard, Premium, Repair, Custom)
- **priority:** Select field (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- **is_active:** Boolean to enable/disable template usage
- **description:** Text description of the template's purpose

### Cost Estimation
- **estimated_cost:** Total estimated cost for projects using this template
- **estimated_materials_cost:** Estimated cost of materials/parts
- **estimated_hours:** Expected labor hours for completion

### Pad Configuration
- **clarinet_pad_map:** Link to Clarinet Pad Map for pad specifications
- **auto_create_pad_map:** Boolean to automatically create pad maps

### Template Content
- **template_operations:** Table of Clarinet Setup Operation child records
- **template_tasks:** Table of Clarinet Template Task child records  
- **checklist_items:** Table of Setup Checklist Item child records
  - `pad_map` (Link): Associated pad configuration reference
- **Child Tables:**
  - `default_operations` → `Clarinet Setup Operation` (standard operations to perform)
  - `checklist_items` → `Setup Checklist Item` (QA checklist items)
  - `template_tasks` → `Clarinet Template Task` (task blueprints with scheduling)

## Business Rules

### Validation Logic
1. **Auto-create Pad Map**: If no pad_map is specified but clarinet_model exists, automatically creates and links a new Clarinet Pad Map
2. **Template Task Validation**:
   - Enforces unique sequence numbers across all template tasks
   - Requires subject field for all template tasks
   - Prevents duplicate sequence values that could cause ordering conflicts

### Template Application
Templates serve as blueprints that populate three areas of a Clarinet Initial Setup:
1. **Operations**: Copied to `operations_performed` table
2. **Checklist**: Copied to `checklist` table  
3. **Tasks**: Generate individual Clarinet Setup Task documents with scheduling

## Server Logic (`setup_template.py`)

### Lifecycle Hooks
1. **`validate()`**:
   - **Pad Map Auto-creation**: Creates linked Clarinet Pad Map if missing
   - **Template Task Quality Checks**:
     - Validates unique sequence numbers using set tracking
     - Ensures all template tasks have required subject field
     - Throws descriptive errors for violations

### Auto-generated Types
The DocType includes comprehensive type hints for:
- `checklist_items`: Table of SetupChecklistItem records
- `clarinet_model`: Link to Instrument Model
- `default_operations`: Table of ClarinetSetupOperation records
- `pad_map`: Link to Clarinet Pad Map
- `template_name`: Unique internal identifier
- `template_tasks`: Table of ClarinetTemplateTask records

### Dependencies
- **Clarinet Pad Map**: Auto-created when missing
- **Instrument Model**: Required for template targeting
- **Child DocTypes**: Setup Checklist Item, Clarinet Setup Operation, Clarinet Template Task

## Client Logic (`setup_template.js`)

### Form Events
1. **`refresh(frm)`**: Adds utility buttons for saved documents only

### Child Table Events
1. **`template_tasks_add(frm, cdt, cdn)`**:
   - **Auto-sequencing**: Automatically assigns sequence numbers to new template task rows
   - **Gap Management**: Uses increments of 10 (10, 20, 30, etc.) to allow for easy reordering
   - **Logic**: Finds maximum existing sequence, adds 10 for new row

### Utility Functions

#### Template Tools (Available via custom buttons)
1. **"Preview Task Schedule"**: 
   - Opens interactive dialog for schedule preview
   - Allows user to specify hypothetical setup date
   - Displays calculated start/end dates for all template tasks
   - Shows duration, priority, and sequencing information
   - Helpful for validating template timing before application

2. **"Normalize Sequence"**:
   - Reorders all template tasks by current sequence values
   - Reassigns sequence numbers in increments of 10
   - Eliminates gaps and ensures clean ordering
   - Updates form display immediately

### Dialog Functions
- **`preview_schedule_dialog(frm)`**: Creates modal dialog with date picker and preview table
- **`render_preview(rows, setup_date)`**: Generates HTML table showing calculated schedule
- **Date Calculations**: Uses Frappe date utilities for accurate start/end date computation

### Helper Functions
- **`normalize_sequence(frm)`**: Sorts and renumbers template tasks
- **`add_tools(frm)`**: Manages button state to prevent duplicates

## Data Integrity
- **Required Fields**: None at schema level, but template_tasks require subject via validation
- **Unique Fields**: 
  - `template_name` (unique, set once)
  - Template task sequence numbers (enforced in validate())
- **Auto-created**: `pad_map` field when missing
- **Fetch Fields**: None defined

## Template Task Structure
Each template task (`template_tasks` table) contains:
- **`sequence`** (Int): Ordering number for task generation
- **`subject`** (Data): Task title (required)
- **`description`** (Small Text): Optional detailed instructions
- **`default_priority`** (Select): Priority level (Low/Medium/High/Urgent)
- **`exp_start_offset_days`** (Int): Days after setup date to start (default: 0)
- **`exp_duration_days`** (Int): Expected task duration in days (default: 1)
- **`depends_on`** (Table): Template-level dependencies (links to other template tasks)

## Template Application Workflow
1. **Select Template**: User chooses setup template on Clarinet Initial Setup
2. **Load Operations**: Button copies `default_operations` to setup document
3. **Create Tasks**: Button generates individual Clarinet Setup Task documents
4. **Task Generation Logic**:
   - Sorts template tasks by sequence
   - Calculates actual dates using setup_date + offset
   - Creates linked task documents with proper metadata
   - Establishes dependencies between generated tasks

## Test Plan

- **Linked DocTypes**: Instrument Model, Clarinet Pad Map
- **Child DocTypes**: Setup Checklist Item, Clarinet Setup Operation, Clarinet Template Task
- **Generated Documents**: Clarinet Setup Task (created from template tasks)

## 🚀 Overview

The **Setup Template** doctype defines standard operating procedures for clarinet setup by model, including required pad maps, operation lists, and setup checklists. It is foundational for automation and quality control in the instrument setup process, tightly integrated with `Clarinet Initial Setup` to ensure consistency across technicians and jobs.

- Templates are referenced directly by the `setup_template` field in the `Clarinet Initial Setup` doctype.
- When a template is selected in an initial setup, all default operations and checklist items are automatically loaded and enforced.
- Automatically creates a unique Clarinet Pad Map (if missing) for the given model, ensuring each template is ready for operational use.

## 🔗 Integration with Clarinet Initial Setup

- `Clarinet Initial Setup` references `Setup Template` via the `setup_template` field.
- When a template is selected in Clarinet Initial Setup:
  - All **Default Operations** (from this template) are loaded as operations to perform.
  - All **Checklist Items** (from this template) are loaded into the checklist table.
  - The **Pad Map** ensures that all pad locations, notes, and pad types are consistent per model.
- **Automation Flow:**
  - **SetupTemplate.save()** ⇒ creates Pad Map if needed
  - **ClarinetInitialSetup.validate()/load_operations_from_template()** ⇒ loads operations and checklist from template
  - Ensures all `Clarinet Initial Setup` records have a complete and model-specific set of tasks/checks

## 🛡️ Security, Compliance & Audit

- Only Service Manager can create, delete, or modify templates; Technicians can read for usage.
- Pad maps are auto-created only when missing, never overwritten.
- Full field coverage; no direct access to other models except via explicit links.

---

## 💡 Developer Tips & Best Practices

- **Backend:**
  - Always define new clarinet models/templates in this DocType first; downstream automations depend on it.
  - Never delete templates in use by a Clarinet Initial Setup record.
  - Add checklist/operations logic to template before creating new setup records.
- **Frontend:**
  - Client script is intentionally empty—extend only for UI features, not business logic.
- **Testing:**
  - Add tests for pad map auto-creation, template uniqueness, and correct loading of operations/checklists.

- **DocType Type:** Child Table (`istable: 1`)
- **Naming:** Auto-formatted as `CSO-{#####}` (sequential numbering)
- **Parent DocTypes:** Used in various setup-related master documents
- **Engine:** InnoDB for transaction safety

### Operation Classification
- **`operation_type`** (Select): Type of technical operation performed (required, in list/filter views)
  - Options: Tone Hole Reaming, Tone Hole Repair, Chimney Leak, Tenon Fitting, Key Height Adjustment, Spring Tension Adjustment, Pad Leveling, Cork Replacement, Setup, Other
- **`section`** (Select): Physical section of instrument where work performed (in list/filter views)

        "section": "Upper Joint",
        "component_ref": "Register Key Chimney",
        "details": "Sealed hairline crack in register key chimney with specialized adhesive",
        "completed": 1
    }
]
```

### Mechanical Adjustments

        "details": "Polished and protective coating applied to bell exterior",
        "completed": 0
    }
]
```

## Business Rules

### Operation Sequencing
- Operations should be performed in logical sequence (disassembly → repair → adjustment → reassembly)
- Some operations have prerequisites (pad leveling requires pad replacement first)
- Section-specific operations should be grouped for efficiency
- Final setup operations typically performed last

### Completion Tracking
```python
def validate_completion(self):
    """Validate operation completion requirements"""
    if self.completed:
        if not self.details or len(self.details.strip()) < 10:
            frappe.throw("Completed operations must have detailed notes (minimum 10 characters)")
        
        # Some operations require specific validation
        if self.operation_type == "Pad Leveling":
            if "leak test" not in self.details.lower():
                frappe.throw("Pad leveling operations must include leak test verification")
```

### Quality Standards
- All operations must include sufficient detail for quality review
- Critical operations (tone hole work, pad adjustments) require supervisor verification
- Measurements must be recorded where applicable
- Before/after photos recommended for major repairs

### Progress Calculation
```python
def calculate_operation_progress(parent_doc):
    """Calculate completion percentage for operation list"""
    if not hasattr(parent_doc, 'operations') or not parent_doc.operations:
        return 0.0
    
    total_ops = len(parent_doc.operations)
    completed_ops = sum(1 for op in parent_doc.operations if op.completed)
    
    return (completed_ops / total_ops) * 100.0
```

## Integration Points

### Setup Project Integration
- Operations feed into overall project progress calculation
- Completed operations enable downstream workflow steps
- Operation details included in setup certificates and documentation
- Time tracking can be associated with specific operations

### Quality Control Integration
```python
def generate_qc_checklist(operations):
    """Generate quality control checklist from completed operations"""
    qc_items = []
    
    for op in operations:
        if op.completed and op.operation_type in ["Pad Leveling", "Tone Hole Repair", "Key Height Adjustment"]:
            qc_items.append({

## Error Prevention

### Common Mistakes Prevention
```python
def validate_operation_logic(self):
    """Prevent common operation sequence errors"""
    # Component reference validation
    if self.section == "Mouthpiece" and "tone hole" in self.component_ref.lower():
        frappe.throw("Mouthpieces do not have tone holes - check section assignment")
    
    # Operation type validation  
    if self.operation_type == "Tenon Fitting" and self.section not in ["All", "Upper Joint", "Lower Joint", "Barrel"]:
        frappe.throw("Tenon fitting only applies to joints with tenons")
    
    # Completion logic
    if self.completed and not self.details:
        frappe.throw("Completed operations must include detailed work notes")
```

### Quality Gates
- Critical operations require supervisor sign-off
- Measurement-dependent operations must include actual measurements
- Before/after documentation required for major repairs
- Customer approval needed for operations beyond original scope

## Reporting Applications

### Technical Work Summary
```python
def generate_technical_summary(operations):
    """Generate customer-friendly technical work summary"""

   - Checks that reviewed items have review_date and reviewed_by

2. **before_insert_handler():**
   - Auto-generates sequence number if not provided
   - Sets default priority to "Medium" if not specified
   - Initializes completion tracking fields

3. **on_change():**
   - Updates parent project progress when items completed
   - Triggers notifications for mandatory item completion
   - Updates quality metrics for parent project

### Derived Fields
- **completion_percentage:** Calculated across all checklist items in parent
- **days_to_complete:** Time elapsed from parent start to item completion
- **is_overdue:** Whether item completion is behind schedule
- **quality_score:** Calculated quality rating based on completion and review

### Side Effects

4. **Progress Update:** Parent project progress recalculated

### Mandatory Item Requirements
- All mandatory items must be completed before project can be submitted
- Critical mandatory items may block project progression entirely
- Failed mandatory items create corrective action requirements

### Review Process
```python
def handle_review_completion(self):
    """Process checklist item review completion"""
    if self.review_status == "Approved":
        self.mark_item_approved()
        self.update_parent_progress()
    elif self.review_status == "Rejected":
        self.create_corrective_action_task()
        self.reset_completion_status()
    elif self.review_status == "Needs Rework":
        self.create_rework_notification()
        self.set_rework_required_flag()
```

## Quality Metrics Integration

    completed_items = sum(1 for item in parent.checklist if item.is_completed)
    return (completed_items / total_items) * 100.0
```

### Mandatory Item Blocking
```python
def can_submit_project(parent):
    """Check if project can be submitted based on mandatory checklist items"""
    mandatory_items = [item for item in parent.checklist if item.is_mandatory]
    incomplete_mandatory = [item for item in mandatory_items if not item.is_completed]
    
    if incomplete_mandatory:
        frappe.throw(f"Cannot submit project. {len(incomplete_mandatory)} mandatory checklist items incomplete.")
    
    return True

## 🛡️ Security, Compliance & Audit

- Intake link is enforced (no orphaned setups).
- All critical events (submit, validation, automation) log errors using `frappe.log_error()`.
- User actions tracked (changes, seen, views).
- All permissions follow Frappe model: only Technician, Service Manager, System Manager, or Owner (Customer) can create or submit.

---

## 💡 Developer Tips & Best Practices

- **Backend:**
  - Add checklist/operations automation in their respective methods to maintain coverage and avoid orphan records.
  - Always use error handling + `frappe.log_error()` in background/async methods.
  - New fields or relationships? Update both JSON, backend, and client-side for full integration.
- **Frontend:**
  - Keep all custom button and event logic inside the correct event handlers (`refresh`, `validate`, `after_save`).
  - Use Frappe FileUploader widget for image attachments.
  - Real-time collaboration (WebSocket) logic is opt-in: test on staging!
- **Testing:**
  - Extend `test_clarinet_initial_setup.py` for every automation or validation rule added.
  - Use fixtures for Template, Instrument, and User in integration tests.
- **PDF Generation:**
  - `_generate_setup_certificate` uses the portal’s template; test output on each change.

### Validation Hooks
1. **validate():**
   - Validates project dates (end date after start date)
   - Ensures setup_template compatibility with instrument type
   - Calculates actual costs from child table data
   - Updates progress based on completed tasks

2. **before_insert():**
   - Auto-generates project_id if not provided
   - Sets default dates based on template estimates
   - Applies template defaults if setup_template is selected

3. **on_update():**
   - Updates actual dates when status changes
   - Recalculates costs when materials or tasks change
   - Triggers notifications for status changes

4. **before_submit():**
   - Validates all required checklist items are completed
   - Ensures actual costs are within reasonable range of estimates
   - Confirms all critical tasks are completed

### Derived Fields
- **actual_cost:** Calculated from operations_performed materials cost + (labor_hours * hourly_rate)
- **progress:** Calculated as percentage of completed setup_tasks
- **duration_days:** Calculated difference between start and end dates
- **cost_variance:** Difference between estimated and actual costs

### Side Effects

- `sequence` must be unique within parent template

### Referential Integrity
- `assigned_role`: Must exist in Role DocType
- Dependencies must reference valid tasks within same template
- Parent template must exist and be active

### Business Constraints
- sequence must be positive integer
- estimated_hours must be positive number

## Template Task Dependencies

### Dependency Management
- **Linear Dependencies:** Task B starts after Task A completes
- **Parallel Dependencies:** Multiple tasks can depend on single predecessor
- **Milestone Dependencies:** Milestone tasks can gate subsequent phases

### Dependency Validation
```python
def validate_dependencies(self):
    """Prevent circular dependencies in template tasks"""
    visited = set()
    rec_stack = set()
    
    def has_cycle(task_name):
        visited.add(task_name)
        rec_stack.add(task_name)
        
        for dep in get_dependencies(task_name):
            if dep not in visited:
                if has_cycle(dep):
                    return True
            elif dep in rec_stack:
                return True
                
        rec_stack.remove(task_name)
        return False
```

## Quality & Completion Criteria

### Task Acceptance
- **Quality Criteria:** Defined acceptance standards
- **Deliverables:** Expected outputs from task
- **Review Process:** Who reviews and approves task completion

### Milestone Tasks
- **Project Gates:** Major decision points in project lifecycle
- **Phase Transitions:** Moving between project phases
- **Quality Gates:** QA checkpoints before proceeding

## Template Optimization

### Critical Path Analysis
- **Duration Calculation:** Longest path through dependent tasks
- **Resource Optimization:** Balancing task assignments
- **Schedule Compression:** Identifying opportunities to reduce duration

### Template Metrics
- **Complexity Score:** Based on task count and dependencies
- **Estimated Duration:** Total hours from critical path
- **Resource Requirements:** Roles and skills needed
- **Risk Assessment:** Tasks with high uncertainty or complexity

## Usage Patterns

### Standard Setup Template Tasks
```python
standard_tasks = [
    {
        "sequence": 1,
        "task_name": "Initial Inspection",
        "subject": "Perform initial instrument inspection and assessment",
        "task_type": "Setup",
        "estimated_hours": 1.0,
        "is_mandatory": 1
    },
    {
        "sequence": 2,
        "task_name": "Pad Replacement",
        "subject": "Replace clarinet pads according to specifications",
        "task_type": "Setup", 
        "estimated_hours": 4.0,
        "depends_on": ["Initial Inspection"]
    }
]
```

### Premium Setup Template Tasks
```python
premium_tasks = [
    {
        "sequence": 1,
        "task_name": "Advanced Inspection",
        "subject": "Comprehensive inspection including tone hole analysis",
        "task_type": "Setup",
        "estimated_hours": 2.0,
        "is_mandatory": 1
    },
    {
        "sequence": 2,
        "task_name": "Precision Pad Fitting",
        "subject": "Custom fit pads with precision measurements",
        "task_type": "Setup",
        "estimated_hours": 6.0,
        "assigned_role": "Senior Technician"
    }

## Purpose
The Clarinet Task Depends On DocType serves as a child table to manage task dependencies in both template tasks and actual project tasks. It enables complex dependency relationships, critical path analysis, and proper task sequencing in clarinet setup projects.

## Schema Summary

### Basic Information
- **DocType Type:** Child Table (`is_child_table: 1`)
- **Parent DocTypes:** 
  - Clarinet Template Task (depends_on_tasks table)
  - Clarinet Setup Task (depends_on table)
- **Key Fields:**
  - `task` (Link): Name of the task that this task depends on
  - `dependency_type` (Select): Type of dependency relationship
  - `lag_time` (Float): Delay time after prerequisite completion
  - `dependency_status` (Select): Current status of the dependency

### Dependency Configuration
- **task_name** (Data): Display name of the dependent task (read-only)
- **project** (Link): Project context for validation (read-only from parent)
- **is_critical** (Check): Whether this dependency is on the critical path
- **can_overlap** (Check): Whether tasks can run in parallel with lag

### Timing & Scheduling
- **lag_time_uom** (Select): Unit for lag time (Hours, Days, Weeks)
- **lead_time** (Float): Time this task can start before prerequisite completes
- **constraint_type** (Select): Type of scheduling constraint
- **constraint_date** (Date): Specific date constraint if applicable

### Status & Validation
- **dependency_status** (Select): Current status (Pending, Satisfied, Blocked)
- **validation_date** (Datetime): When dependency was last validated
- **notes** (Text): Additional information about the dependency relationship

### Links
- **Task:** The prerequisite task that must be completed first
- **Project:** Context project for cross-validation (inherited from parent)

## Business Rules

### Validation Hooks (Child Table Methods)
1. **validate():**
   - Prevents tasks from depending on themselves (direct circular dependency)
   - Validates that dependent task exists in same project/template
   - Ensures lag_time and lead_time are non-negative
   - Checks that dependency_type is valid for the task types involved

2. **before_insert_handler():**
   - Validates no circular dependencies will be created
   - Sets default dependency_type to "Finish-to-Start" if not specified
   - Calculates initial dependency_status based on prerequisite task status

3. **on_change():**
   - Updates parent task's dependency status
   - Recalculates project critical path if dependency is critical
   - Triggers scheduling updates for dependent tasks

### Derived Fields
- **task_name:** Fetched from linked task's subject/name
- **dependency_status:** Calculated based on prerequisite task completion
- **is_critical:** Determined by critical path analysis
- **effective_delay:** Calculated total delay including lag and lead times

### Side Effects
- Adding dependencies may delay task start dates
- Removing critical dependencies can shorten project duration
- Dependency status changes trigger task availability updates

## Dependency Types

### Finish-to-Start (FS)
- **Description:** Successor task cannot start until predecessor finishes
- **Use Case:** Standard sequential task flow
- **Example:** "Pad Installation" depends on "Old Pad Removal" finishing

### Start-to-Start (SS)
- **Description:** Successor task cannot start until predecessor starts
- **Use Case:** Parallel tasks that must begin together
- **Example:** "Quality Inspection" starts when "Setup Work" starts

### Finish-to-Finish (FF)
- **Description:** Successor task cannot finish until predecessor finishes
- **Use Case:** Tasks that must complete together
- **Example:** "Documentation" finishes when "Setup Work" finishes

### Start-to-Finish (SF)
- **Description:** Successor task cannot finish until predecessor starts (rare)
- **Use Case:** Handoff scenarios
- **Example:** "Old System Shutdown" after "New System Startup" begins

## Lag and Lead Time

### Lag Time
- **Purpose:** Mandatory delay after prerequisite completion
- **Example:** 24-hour drying time after applying adhesive
- **Calculation:** Successor start = Predecessor end + Lag time

### Lead Time  
- **Purpose:** Allow successor to start before prerequisite completes
- **Example:** Preparation work can start before materials arrive
- **Calculation:** Successor start = Predecessor end - Lead time

### Time Units
- **Hours:** For short technical delays (drying, curing)
- **Days:** For typical task scheduling
- **Weeks:** For long-term project planning

## Critical Path Integration

### Critical Path Determination
```python
def update_critical_path_status(self):
    """Update whether this dependency is on the critical path"""
    project = get_parent_project()
    critical_tasks = calculate_critical_path(project)
    
    predecessor = self.task
    successor = self.parent
    
    self.is_critical = (
        predecessor in critical_tasks and 
        successor in critical_tasks and
        self.dependency_type == "Finish-to-Start"
    )
```

### Schedule Impact Analysis
- **Critical Dependencies:** Delays directly impact project end date
- **Non-Critical Dependencies:** Have slack time available
- **Free Float:** Time dependency can be delayed without affecting successors
- **Total Float:** Time dependency can be delayed without affecting project

## Dependency Status Management

### Status Calculation
```python
def calculate_dependency_status(self):
    """Calculate current status of this dependency"""
    prerequisite_task = frappe.get_doc("Clarinet Setup Task", self.task)
    
    if prerequisite_task.status == "Completed":
        if self.lag_time > 0:
            completion_date = prerequisite_task.actual_end_date
            available_date = completion_date + timedelta(hours=self.lag_time)
            if now() >= available_date:
                return "Satisfied"
            else:
                return "Pending"
        else:
            return "Satisfied"
    elif prerequisite_task.status in ["Cancelled", "On Hold"]:
        return "Blocked"
    else:
        return "Pending"
```

### Automatic Status Updates
- **Task Completion:** Updates all dependent task statuses
- **Task Delay:** Recalculates successor availability
- **Task Cancellation:** Marks dependent tasks as blocked

## Data Integrity

### Required Fields
- `task`: Prerequisite task reference (required)
- `dependency_type`: Type of dependency relationship (required)

### Defaults
- `dependency_type`: "Finish-to-Start" (most common)
- `lag_time`: 0.0 (no delay by default)
- `lead_time`: 0.0 (no lead time by default)
- `lag_time_uom`: "Hours" (default time unit)
- `can_overlap`: 0 (no overlap by default)

### Unique Constraints
- Combination of parent task and prerequisite task must be unique
- No duplicate dependencies for same task pair

### Referential Integrity
- `task`: Must exist in appropriate task DocType (Template or Setup)
- Parent context must be valid project or template
- Circular dependencies prevented through validation

### Business Constraints
- lag_time and lead_time must be non-negative
- Task cannot depend on itself (direct or indirect)
- Dependency must be within same project/template scope
- constraint_date must be realistic for project timeline

## Circular Dependency Prevention

### Detection Algorithm
```python
def check_for_cycles(self):
    """Detect circular dependencies before creating new dependency"""
    def has_cycle(current_task, target_task, visited, rec_stack):
        visited.add(current_task)
        rec_stack.add(current_task)
        
        # Get all tasks that current_task depends on
        dependencies = get_task_dependencies(current_task)
        
        for dep_task in dependencies:
            if dep_task == target_task:
                return True  # Found cycle
            elif dep_task not in visited:
                if has_cycle(dep_task, target_task, visited, rec_stack):
                    return True
            elif dep_task in rec_stack:
                return True  # Back edge found
        
        rec_stack.remove(current_task)
        return False
    
    # Check if adding this dependency creates a cycle
    return has_cycle(self.task, self.parent, set(), set())
```

## Usage Patterns

### Standard Setup Dependencies
```python
# Typical task dependency chain for clarinet setup
standard_dependencies = [
    {
        "task": "Initial Inspection",
        "successor": "Disassembly", 
        "dependency_type": "Finish-to-Start"
    },
    {
        "task": "Disassembly",
        "successor": "Cleaning",
        "dependency_type": "Finish-to-Start"
    },
    {
        "task": "Cleaning", 
        "successor": "Pad Replacement",
        "dependency_type": "Finish-to-Start"
    }
]
```

### Parallel Task Dependencies
```python
# Tasks that can run in parallel after prerequisite
parallel_dependencies = [
    {
        "task": "Disassembly",
        "successor": "Key Cleaning",
        "dependency_type": "Finish-to-Start"
    },
    {
        "task": "Disassembly", 
        "successor": "Body Cleaning",
        "dependency_type": "Finish-to-Start"
    }
]
```

### Lag Time Dependencies
```python
# Dependencies with mandatory waiting periods
lag_dependencies = [
    {
        "task": "Apply Adhesive",
        "successor": "Install Pads", 
        "dependency_type": "Finish-to-Start",
        "lag_time": 24,
        "lag_time_uom": "Hours"
    }
]
```
