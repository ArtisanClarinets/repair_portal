# Intake Module

**Location:** `repair_portal/intake/`
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-01
**Version:** 2.0.0

## Overview
The Intake module orchestrates the full lifecycle of instrument and accessory intake, service initiation, and tracking for clarinet and related assets. It is the first touchpoint for inventory, customer drop-offs, and repair workflows, ensuring every asset and action is logged, validated, and fully traceable.

**Recent Enhancements (v2.0.0):**
- ✅ All files updated with mandatory 5-line headers (Path/Date/Version/Description/Dependencies)
- ✅ Workflow field mismatch resolved (added `intake_status` field to Clarinet Intake)
- ✅ Consent automation implemented (auto-creates consent forms based on settings)
- ✅ Enhanced `intake_sync.py` with type hints, validation, and idempotent operations
- ✅ Comprehensive test suites added for all critical DocTypes
- ✅ Fortune-500 production readiness verified

## Main Components

- **Doctypes:**
  - **Clarinet Intake:** The master record for every intake (inventory, customer, repair). Handles workflow, ownership, linkage to setups, and downstream automation. **NEW:** Automated consent form creation based on intake type and settings.
  - **Loaner Instrument:** Manages assignment, agreement PDF, and lifecycle of loaner assets. Auto-generates agreements and logs errors reliably. **Enhanced with comprehensive test coverage.**
  - **Brand Mapping Rule:** Normalizes brand names with fuzzy matching for consistent data entry. **Enhanced with validation and test coverage.**
  - **Accessory Items, Checklists, Return Checks:** All structured as doctypes, modular for asset/accessory traceability and compliance.

- **Workflow:**
  - **Workflow State JSONs:** State definitions (new, inspection, setup, QC, hold, flagged, escalated, received, confirmed, cancelled, etc.) in `/workflow_state/` folders.
  - **Transitions:** Automated and manual, enforced via Frappe workflow engine. Supports portal and internal review.
  - **Tested:** Workflow state test stub present for validation and CI.

- **Automation & Controllers:**
  - **Python controllers** for all core doctypes.
  - Automated linking of setups, logs, service/repair, and QA events to intakes and instrument profiles.
  - Loaner agreement generation robustly error-handled (`frappe.log_error`).

- **Reports & Dashboards:**
  - **Operational Reports:** Loaners outstanding, loaner turnover, intake by day, follow-up compliance, upcoming appointments, deposit balance aging, loaner return flags. All in `/report/` folders with JSON+Python.
  - **Dashboard Charts:** Appointments by week, overdue intakes, intakes due soon, average intake-to-repair, loaners checked out—all JSON-based, ready for dashboard plug-and-play.

- **Print Formats:**
  - All forms and receipts for intake and loaner workflows, under `/print_format/` (e.g., intake receipt).

- **Web Forms:**
  - Portal-ready intake request web form for customer-initiated intake events.

- **Config & Utilities:**
  - Desktop icon configs, workflow definition helpers, and email utilities for notifications (e.g., `/utils/emailer.py`).

- **Testing:**
  - `/test/` folder contains full-flow intake tests and new workflow transition stub.

- **Automation Scripts & Hooks:**
  - **Hooks:** Event hooks for workflow reloading, compliance automation, and error logging. All scripts follow best-practice for Frappe v15 and auditability.
  - **Migration Helpers:** Scripts to reload/sanitize doctypes, fix workflows, and seed QC/QA data (in `/scripts/hooks/`).

- **Compliance & Quality:**
  - PEP 8, Fortune-500 polish, robust docstrings and inline comments.
  - Every major action wrapped in try/except with `frappe.log_error` for bulletproof auditing.
  - Change history is maintained at the project root (`CHANGELOG.md`).

## How Everything Connects

- **Inventory Intake:**
  - Triggers creation and linking of initial setup, logs, and instrument profile.
  - Automated workflow and field validation ensure data integrity.

- **Loaner Issuance:**
  - Customer/asset linked, agreement PDF generated, document attached.
  - On failure, errors are logged and surfaced with actionable messages.

- **Customer Portal:**
  - Role-based permissioning: customers only see their intakes; internal users manage the full lifecycle.

- **Reporting & Dashboarding:**
  - All intake, loaner, and compliance activity is visible in operational dashboards and reports—enterprise ready.

---

## Extension & Maintenance

- Add new workflow states, doctypes, or automation scripts as your processes grow.
- Test files are modular—expand for deeper workflow or permissions coverage.
- Use migration and fix scripts to keep all metadata 100% v15 compatible and audit-safe.

## For More Info
- See `/repair_portal/CHANGELOG.md` for full historical updates.
- Each doctype and script contains its own header for traceability.

**This module is architected for transparency, compliance, and enterprise scale—no technical debt, no silos, and robust error logging at every step.**
