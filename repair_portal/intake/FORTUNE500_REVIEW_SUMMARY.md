**Date:** 2025-10-05  
**Reviewer:** Fortune-500 Clarinet Platform Audit Team  
**Module:** `repair_portal/intake`

---

## Executive Summary
- ✅ Workflow-state UX unified: HTML badges and SLA panels replace legacy `intake_status`, aligned to `workflow_state`
- ✅ Analytics restored: dashboard heatmap and Intake SLA Pulse report illuminate cycle times and backlog
- ✅ Security tightened: API consolidation with ownership checks, loaner QA access restricted to staff
- ✅ Documentation/tooling refreshed: READMEs, changelog, next steps, and verification harness updated to enforce new architecture

The intake desk experience now delivers clear status telemetry, reliable analytics, hardened permissions, and enterprise-grade deployment tooling suitable for clarinet repair operations at scale.

## Key Enhancements

### Workflow & UX
- Retired `intake_status` field; introduced `workflow_stage_badge` and `sla_commitment_panel` HTML fields bound to `workflow_state`
- Added cancel transitions and SLA-aware notifications via workflow JSON and list view bulk actions
- Client script renders branded badges, SLA countdowns, and quick actions tied to hardened APIs

### Automation & Analytics
- `clarinet_intake_timeline.get_timeline_data` aggregates comments, versions, inspections, and repair orders for dashboard heatmap
- Intake SLA Pulse script report measures backlog, overdue promises, and loaner risk; linked in Repair Portal workspace
- Template loader installs intake-specific defaults, enabling repeatable deployments

### Security & Compliance
- API endpoints for serial and inspection lookup now enforce Contact → Customer → Intake ownership chains
- Loaner Return Check permissions restricted to internal roles; portal form expanded for transport photos and risk disclosures
- Verification harness validates workflow HTML widgets, analytics availability, consent automation, tests, and linting

### Documentation & Runbooks
- Intake README, Clarinet Intake DocType README, and desk UX guide updated to describe workflow_state architecture
- Deployment script refreshed to summarize workflow badge deployment tasks
- Next Steps runbook emphasizes verification harness and SLA dashboard checks post-deployment

---

## Verification Artifacts
- `bench execute repair_portal.intake.scripts.verify_intake_module.run_verification`
- `bench run-tests --module repair_portal.intake.doctype.clarinet_intake.test_clarinet_intake`
- Intake SLA Pulse report accessible from Repair Portal workspace
- Intake Receipt QR print preview validated

---

## Recommendations
- Maintain nightly verification harness execution (via scheduler or CI) to catch workflow/analytics regressions early
- Periodically review Intake SLA Pulse and workspace dashboards to tune staffing and SLA commitments
- Re-export fixtures (workspaces, notifications, templates) when modifying intake defaults
- Extend automated tests to cover new portal interactions as additional features roll out

**Status:** ✅ Fortune-500 intake desk UX achieved and sustained
