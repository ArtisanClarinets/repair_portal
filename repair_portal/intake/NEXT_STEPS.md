# 🎉 Intake Module Fortune-500 Review - COMPLETE

**Date:** 2025-10-05  
**Status:** ✅ ACTION PLAN CLOSED  
**Module:** `repair_portal/intake/`

---

## ✅ Completion Status
- 100% of remediation items delivered (workflow-state UX, analytics, permissions, documentation, verification tooling)
- Verification harness updated to guard against regressions in workflow visuals and analytics
- Deployment assets and runbooks refreshed for workflow_state-driven architecture

---

## 📊 Deliverables Snapshot

### UX & Workflow
- Replaced legacy `intake_status` select with workflow-state HTML badges and SLA panels
- Added cancel transitions across workflow JSON and list view bulk actions
- Restored dashboard heatmap via `clarinet_intake_timeline.get_timeline_data`

### Automation & APIs
- Consolidated intake APIs in `repair_portal.intake.api` with ownership enforcement
- Loaner Return Check permissions restricted to staff roles; portal web form enhanced with transport/risk/photos
- Template loader now seeds intake defaults via dedicated fixtures

### Documentation & Tooling
- Updated module/doctype READMEs, desk UX guide, changelog, and deployment script
- Verification harness validates workflow-state UX, analytics, consent automation, tests, and linting

---

## 🚀 Deployment & Validation Steps

### Phase 1: Local Verification (Required)
```bash
# Navigate to frappe-bench
cd /home/frappe/frappe-bench

# Step 1: Migrate database
bench --site erp.artisanclarinets.com migrate

# Step 2: Build assets
bench build --app repair_portal

# Step 3: Run verification harness
bench --site erp.artisanclarinets.com execute repair_portal.intake.scripts.verify_intake_module.run_verification

# Step 4: Run targeted tests
bench --site erp.artisanclarinets.com run-tests --module repair_portal.intake.doctype.clarinet_intake.test_clarinet_intake
bench --site erp.artisanclarinets.com run-tests --module repair_portal.intake.doctype.loaner_instrument.test_loaner_instrument
bench --site erp.artisanclarinets.com run-tests --module repair_portal.intake.doctype.brand_mapping_rule.test_brand_mapping_rule
```

**Expected Output:**
- ✅ Migration completes without schema diffs (workflow_state already present; HTML widgets persisted)
- ✅ Verification harness passes all categories (headers, workflow UX, consent automation, tests, linting)
- ✅ All intake-related tests green

### Phase 2: Configuration (Recommended)
- Confirm Clarinet Intake Settings for consent automation
- Review Intake SLA Pulse report and ensure workspace link renders
- Verify Intake Receipt QR print format generates successfully for a sample record

### Phase 3: Production Deployment Checklist
1. Backup production database
2. Deploy code and run `bench migrate`
3. Rebuild assets and clear cache (`bench clear-cache`)
4. Execute verification harness on production site
5. Render Intake Receipt PDF for smoke test
6. Monitor logs and SLA dashboard for 24 hours
7. Brief staff on workflow badge meaning and SLA escalations

## 🔍 Files Modified Summary
- `intake/doctype/clarinet_intake/clarinet_intake.json` — Added HTML workflow widgets, removed legacy select
- `intake/doctype/clarinet_intake/clarinet_intake.js` — Workflow badge rendering + API consolidation
- `intake/workflow/intake_workflow/intake_workflow.json` — Cancel transitions and SLA-aware states
- `intake/doctype/clarinet_intake/clarinet_intake_timeline.py` — Heatmap data provider
- `intake/print_format/intake_receipt.json` — QR-enabled receipt
- `intake/api.py` — Ownership-enforced endpoints
- `intake/web_form/clarinet_intake_request/clarinet_intake_request.json` — Expanded capture fields
- `intake/hooks/load_templates.py` & fixtures — Intake defaults loader
- `intake/scripts/verify_intake_module.py` — Updated verification harness

---

## 📎 Notes
- Re-run template loader (`bench execute repair_portal.intake.hooks.load_templates.load_setup_templates`) after updating fixtures.
- Export fixtures post-deployment to capture workspace/report adjustments if further tweaks occur.
- Maintain nightly scheduler to run verification harness or targeted smoke tests for SLA health.
